		<value>30</value>
		
		<description> maximum-capacity defines a limit beyond which a queue
			cannot use the capacity of the cluster. This provides a means to
			limit how much excess capacity a queue can use. By default, there is
			no limit. The maximum-capacity of a queue can only be greater than
			or equal to its minimum capacity. Default value of -1 implies a
			queue can use complete capacity of the cluster. This property
			could be to curtail certain jobs which are long running in nature
			from occupying more than a  certain percentage of the cluster,
			which in the absence of pre-emption, could lead to capacity
			guarantees of  other queues being affected.  One important
			thing to note is that maximum-capacity is a percentage , so based on
			the cluster's capacity the max capacity would change. So if large
			no of nodes or racks get added to the cluster , max Capacity in 
			absolute terms would increase accordingly.    </description>
